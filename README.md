# CryptoClustering
Challenge 11
This challenge is the first challenge using machine learning and demonstrates the use of KMeans, Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA), and StandardScaler, which were all new concepts to me (being a nontechnical person).  
The objective was to apply my understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, I examined price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year and used clustering with K-means using PCA data to produce a cluster analysis and scaled data.
While undergoing the challenge, I did seek advice from tutors (to ensure I was on the right track) and BCS (particularly for one area of of coding that I got stuck on). 
Although still challenging, I can definitly see the growth between when I first started this course and today. 
Please don't hesitate reach out should you have any question on the file.
